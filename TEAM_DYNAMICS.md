# Team Dynamics

## Skills

### Logical

A logical person can break complex tasks down into simple tasks to complete a goal.

### Continuously learning

Front-end web development is a growing, evolving discipline. Best practices are a moving target. A nimble, agile mind will be able to respond to the unexpected and creatively apply solutions. It also lends itself to the next skill...

### Complementary, not conforming

It is impossible to know everything. We seek to round out each other's skillsets. One person's spike gives space for another person's spike. As a team, we cover more bases.

### Considerate

Knowing that we have different backgrounds and different strengths, we can make no assumptions about what our teammates know. We must seek to be clear and strive to limit the burden we place on our teammates to understand our code.

### Leave it better than you found it

Since we know that we are always improving, it stands to reason that some code may get left behind, especially if it has been untouched for a long time. If the code is tested, feel free to refactor to bring it up to the latest standard.

## New Hires

Do not be afraid to give new hires special projects where they can show off their skills immediately while they get to know the codebase. If they are given a feature, allow them to implement it within their comfort zone. Ask them to describe their approach. After learning from their contribution, we can either take steps to incorporate wonderful things into the remainder of the codebase, or take the opportunity to illustrate comparatively or within the unique constraints of the project at hand why it should be done differently.


## Guild Meeting

### Have an agenda

Ask people to bring what they've been learning either at work or on their own time. Encourage people to discuss technology both that we use and that we do not use.

Bring in code samples. What have you been working on lately?
